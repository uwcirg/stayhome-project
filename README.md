# StayHome
The COVID-19 pandemic is straining existing public health processes and workflows. Many community members may be concerned about developing COVID-19. To support community members, we have developed StayHome.

StayHome (https://stayhome.app) is a mobile-friendly web app that supports people who want to track COVID-19 symptoms; link to CDCâ€™s Self-Checker decision support; record at-risk conditions, exposures/contacts/travel or COVID-19 testing/results; and find sources for information. StayHome lets users choose to share identified or anonymous information with public health agencies. The project is described at https://project.stayhome.app, and the button on that page links to the app, which does not require installation. You do not need an account to access information about COVID-19. Create an account to start self-tracking. The app is available for public use. Feel free to share the links.

Developed by the Clinical Informatics Research Group (CIRG) at University of Washington, 2019-2020. Read more about us at [https://www.cirg.washington.edu/](https://www.cirg.washington.edu/)
