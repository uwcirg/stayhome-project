							<p class="major"><b>Many people are concerned about COVID-19, or are about tracking symptoms they may experience.</b></p>
							<p>StayHome is a mobile app that supports people who want reliable information and resources, and who want to track symptoms and temperature, record COVID-19 testing and results, or identify their unique situations and risks.</p>
							<p>You can use StayHome anonymously to access resources about COVID-19, or you can create an account to self-track. If you include profile information, StayHome <i>lets you choose to share information</i>, either anonymous or identified, with public health agencies responsible for your city/county, state, or country.</p>
							<p>While we hope you will share so we can all learn more about COVID-19, <i>you do not have to share any information</i> to use all of StayHome, and you can delete your account and remove all of your information at any time.</p>
							<p>We continue to add new features and content frequently, so StayHome becomes an ever more valuable tool for you.</p>

							<h2>The Features</h2>
							<p>Knowledge is power, for you as an individual. Knowledge about our community is the power we collectively need to slow the pandemic. Tracking your symptoms puts the ability to monitor possible coronavirus infection in your own hands. Sharing that information helps public health understand how best to intervene, to support us all. StayHome delivers trusted content, and collects valuable information, to help you, us, and our communities.</p>

									<h3>Symptom Tracking</h3>
									<p>You can use StayHome to track your temperature and log upper respiratory symptoms (such as coughing and trouble breathing) you may experience. Tracking your symptoms gives you information you can act on.</p>

									<h3>Exposure or Travel Risk</h3>
									<p>Travel is no longer the primary risk for COVID-19, as it spreads within our communities.  StayHome lets you track travel, but it also lets you track both brief and longer exposures and keep a record of what happened</p>

									<h3>Pregnancy Status & <br/>Health Care Workers</h3>

									<p>There is little known about COVID-19 and pregnancy.  If you are pregnant, and you wish to provide location and contact information, that information may both help us learn more about the impact of COVID-19, as well as provide your information to programs addressing this special situation.  Similarly, if you are a health care worker and you share your information, it may help us better understand interventions based on occupation.</p>

							<h2>Why StayHome?</h2>
							<p>We are university software developers and researchers who write software for clinical care, research, public health, and global health, and we are also people who (mostly) live in Seattle.  We care about our families, friends, and colleagues in our community, in our region, and across the world.</p>
							<p>We are all concerned about the same things:  where can we find good information, are we experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, where can we find testing and care, how do we remember what we have experienced as the weeks progress, and how do we best Stay at Home to minimize the risk to ourselves and others and to “flatten the curve” in our communities?</p>
							<p>During the first week of March, we asked a group of University of Washington students what mattered to them about COVID-19, and found they had the same questions that we did. To meet their needs, and ours, we developed StayHome.  From our previous experience working with public health agencies, we know that the routine processes of those agencies get stretched very thin in situations where the numbers of ill and worried people outweigh the available resources.  But we also know that the middle of an outbreak is no time for public health to switch to new, untested methods.  We have concentrated on answering the questions people have, and creating a way for them to volunteer information which may help public health monitor the overall health of communities.  This may also help make existing processes for case investigation, and identifying the contacts of infected people, easier and require less work, while not upsetting the critical processes currently in place.</p>
