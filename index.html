							<p class="major"><b>Many people are concerned about COVID-19, finding information, making good decisions, and tracking their symptoms and experiences to improve their care.</b></p>
							<p>StayHome is a mobile app that supports people who want reliable information and resources, and who want to track symptoms and temperature, record COVID-19 testing and results, record exposures or travel, and identify their unique situations and risks.</p>
							<p>You can use StayHome anonymously to access resources about COVID-19, or you can create an account to self-track. If you include profile information, StayHome <i>lets you choose if and how to share information</i>, either anonymous or identified, with public health agencies responsible for your city/county, state, or country.</p>
							<p>While we hope you will share so we can all learn more about COVID-19, <i>you do not have to share any information</i> to use all of StayHome, and you can delete your account and remove all of your information at any time.</p>
							<p>We continue to add new features and content frequently, so StayHome becomes an ever more valuable tool for you.</p>

						<h2>What Happened to StayHome?</h2>
						<p>The StayHome app production system was archived in May 2022. Thanks to those who tested it, used it, and provided us with feedback to improve it. We learned something about patient-centered Covid-19 needs and apps, and we learned about what we've come to call "FHIR-native" apps - apps which use constructs within the FHIR standard not only to store clinical data, but also to represent the application logic. Read on for more info on StayHome as a FHIR Native app.</p>

									<h3>StayHome: A FHIR-Native Mobile COVID-19 Symptom Tracker and Public Health Reporting Tool</h3>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold and states experience the impacts of reopened economies, it is critical to efficiently manage new outbreaks through widespread testing and monitoring of both new and possible cases. Existing labor-intensive public health workflows may benefit from information collection directly from individuals through patient-reported outcomes (PROs) systems. Our objective was to develop a reusable, mobile-friendly application for collecting PROs and experiences to support COVID-19 symptom self-monitoring and data sharing with appropriate public health agencies, using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) for interoperability. We conducted a needs assessment and designed and developed StayHome, a mobile PRO administration tool. FHIR serves as the primary data model and driver of business logic. Keycloak, AWS, Docker, and other technologies were used for deployment. Several FHIR modules were used to create a novel “FHIR-native” application design. By leveraging FHIR to shape not only the interface strategy but also the information architecture of the application, StayHome enables the consistent standards-based representation of data and reduces the barrier to integration with public health information systems. FHIR supported rapid application development by providing a domain-appropriate data model and tooling. FHIR modules and implementation guides were referenced in design and implementation. However, there are gaps in the FHIR specification which must be recognized and addressed appropriately. StayHome is live and accessible to the public at https://stayhome.app. The code and resources required to build and deploy the application are available from https://github.com/uwcirg/stayhome-project.</p>

							<h2>StayHome.app Features</h2>
							<p>Knowledge is power, for you as an individual. Knowledge about our community is the power we collectively need to slow the pandemic. Tracking your symptoms puts the ability to monitor possible coronavirus infection in your own hands. Sharing that information helps public health understand how best to intervene, to support us all. StayHome delivers trusted content, and collects valuable information, to help you, us, and our communities.</p>

									<h3>Symptom Tracking</h3>
									<p>You can use StayHome to track your temperature and log upper respiratory symptoms (such as coughing and trouble breathing) you may experience. Tracking your symptoms gives you information you can act on.</p>

									<h3>CDC Symptom Self Checker</h3>
									<p>The CDC's Self-Checker is an interactive tool to help you make decisions and seek appropriate medical care for COVID-19. <br/> Currently you need to enter your symptoms again when using self checker, but a future version of StayHome will be able to send Self-Checker the symptoms you've already recorded (with your permission)</p>

									<h3>Exposure or Travel Risk</h3>

									<h3>Pregnancy, Occupation & Possible Risks</h3>
									
									<p>There is little known about COVID-19 and pregnancy.  If you are pregnant, and you wish to provide location and contact information, that information may both help us learn more about the impact of COVID-19, as well as provide your information to programs addressing this special situation.  Similarly, if you are a health care worker and you share your information, it may help us better understand interventions based on occupation.</p>

							<h2>Why StayHome?</h2>
							
							<p>All of us want to know the same things about COVID-19:  where can we find good information, are we experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, where can we find testing and care, how do we remember what we have experienced as the weeks progress, and how do we best Stay at Home to minimize the risk to ourselves and others and to “flatten the curve” in our communities?</p>
							<p>During the first week of March, we asked a group of University of Washington students what mattered to them about COVID-19, and found they had the same questions that we did. To meet their needs, and ours, we developed StayHome.  From our previous experience working with public health agencies, we know that the routine processes of those agencies get stretched very thin in situations where the numbers of ill and worried people outweigh the available resources.  But we also know that the middle of an outbreak is no time for public health to switch to new, untested methods.  We have concentrated on answering the questions people have, and creating a way for them to volunteer information which may help public health monitor the overall health of communities.  This may also help make existing processes for case investigation, and identifying the contacts of infected people, easier and require less work, while not upsetting the critical processes currently in place.</p>
